# D3-challenge
For this assignment, a scatter plot was created to visualise the relationship between two data variables, `Lack of Healthcare (%)` and `Poverty (%)`, obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The plot was formatted to represent each state with circle elements, and includes state abbreviations in the circles.
